context-management:
  initialization:
    - Scan all *.llms.txt files in the /context directory
    - Process all design documents and notes in the /context directory
    - Prioritize most recent files when building understanding of the project

  progress-tracking:
    - For each development session, create a progress summary file
    - File naming pattern: context/YYYY-MM-DD-development-summary.md
    - Include: developer name, tasks addressed, progress made, decisions taken
    - Update any relevant design documents with implementation details
    - Prompt developers at end of session to summarize their work

  progress-file-format:
    - title: "Development Summary (YYYY-MM-DD)"
    - sections:
        - Developer
        - Tasks Addressed
        - Implementation Progress
        - Key Decisions
        - Next Steps
    - Update existing memory with progress details
    
commit-management:
  commit-memory:
    - Before each commit, create a temporary memory of changes
    - Track files modified, added, or deleted
    - Record purpose and impact of changes
    - Note any architectural decisions made
    - Remember test status and coverage implications
    - Store last commit time for future reference
    - Maintain a history of file changes with their purposes
    
  commit-message-format:
    - Format: "[Component] Brief summary of changes\n\nDetailed description including:\n- Specific changes made\n- Motivation for changes\n- Impact on other components\n- Testing status\n- Time since last commit: X days/hours\n\nFile summary:\n- file1.js: Purpose and role in system\n- file2.js: Purpose and role in system"
    - Components: Core, Quiz, Discord, Contracts, Accounts, Context, Infrastructure
    - Always include affected modules and interfaces
    - Reference related issues or previous work
    - For each new or modified file, provide a 1-line description of its purpose
    
  commit-prompting:
    - When developer indicates readiness to commit:
      - Check last commit time and include time elapsed since last commit
      - Identify all files changed or created since last commit
      - Ask for a brief summary of changes
      - Prompt for motivation and impact if not provided
      - Generate a draft commit message for review including:
        - A summary of what each unstaged file does within the system
        - How the changes relate to the overall architecture
      - Store commit summary in memory for future context
      - Update development summary with major commits

agent-instructions:
  - When a new development session begins, welcome the developer and ask about their focus
  - Reference the project's multi-agent architecture and current implementation approach
  - Offer to help with specific components based on their focus area
  - Periodically remind to document key decisions and implementations
  - Before commits, prompt for description of changes and their purpose
  - At session conclusion, prompt for a summary and create the dated summary file
  - Always maintain context about the monolith-first approach and eventual agent architecture
